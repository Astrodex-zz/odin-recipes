<h1>Pirozhki</h1>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/3 cups of milk</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of salt</li>
    <li>1 table spoon of sugar</li>
    <li>3 1/2 cups of plain flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons of yeast</li>
</ul>


<p>Warm up milk in the microwave oven to ~35 degrees, 
    mix salt, sugar, yeast and 1 cup of flour into the 
    milk. Let it sit in the warm place until the 
    mixture raises, mix in the rest of the flour. 
    The dough should be fairly soft, but not too soft, 
    or it will tear when you fold pirogi.

<p>Fold into shape with filling, then fry in oil</p>

<h2>FILLING</h2>

<p>brown 1 large onion in a frying pan, add 300g of 
    mince (best to mix 150g each of beef and lamb 
    mince), fry until cooked. Make mashed potatoes 
    from 4 large potatoes, mix in the mince/onion 
    mixture, salt and pepper to taste.
